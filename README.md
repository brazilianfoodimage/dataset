This repository contains labeled images of 20 different classes of Brazilian foods. For each food class, a subset of images has been created. Each subset includes an image of a meal, typically containing multiple foods, and a corresponding segmentation mask for the specific food in the subset. These labeled images can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. The dataset is particularly useful for research in the field of food recognition and analysis, as well as for developing applications that require knowledge of Brazilian cuisine.
